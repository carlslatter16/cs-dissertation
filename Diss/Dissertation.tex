%\input{tor} %<- note use of \input{} not \include{} - Need to copy it in!

\section{Ethics Form}
If you scan the Ethics form on one of the multi function printers, you can get a pdf copy.  This can then be included with the \LaTeX\ command
\begin{tcblisting}{listing only}
%\includegraphics{ethics.pdf}
\end{tcblisting}
%Assuming of course you have saved the form  as \path{ethics.pdf}

\section{Risk Assessment Form}
Likewise you can scan and include the Risk Assessment Form
\begin{tcblisting}{listing only}
%\includegraphics{risk-assesment.pdf}
\end{tcblisting}

%current issues with getting references to work properly
%rewatch youtube favoruites and educational playlist again before I submit
%use virus total instead?
%common sense security is paramount over software, especially predatory software when good stuff already exists in the OS.
%Microsoft passees corporate level security, to end users too, an intrusive antivirus on top cna be ineffective.
%windows gets viruses bc of user base, tho linux servers to get targeted

%"Using Tor with a VPN gives you an extra layer of privacy because the VPN encryption prevents the Tor entry node (the Tor server where you enter the hidden network) from seeing your IP address. A compromised Tor entry node is one common way for an attacker to try to break Tor's anonymity."

%Unlike a traditional VPN, Tor doesnâ€™t just relay your connection through a single location. Instead, your data is relayed and transferred through a number of locations. This is called a Tor Circuit.
%https://itsfoss.com/install-tar-browser-linux/

%TOr is a bit like a more elaborate and secured proxy chain, you can the vpn your end and then the exit is secured

%osint, xss, sql injection etc..?

%sort quotation marks out

%for program, domain name whitelist file, breaching detection, not an IPS so not stopping it but can see it. A IPS is the natural progression. DNS domain name size limit, rate limit? Possibly against largest known domain name? It does have pitfalls

%local only web apps, need ssh tunnel forwarded?
%geo blocking - fail2ban, suricata
%ssh keys, what you have AND what you know perhaps? So you have to be there, and know the password
%another account instead of root
%2FA - libpam-google-auth
%disable root login for ssh too, sshd_config
%cronjob update && upgrade
%good sysadmin stuff, checking logs, proccesses, networking etc..
%some of the sections use the same good source for most of them, check thats fine
%re-run through fresh and independant spell and plagarism checker
%c2 detection types in overall defence evaulation
%make code boxes consistant
%Sourcing issue - Paper by ... disusses (before hand)
%switching port numbers, maybe random is better than 2222
%DoS can be about breaking TCP sessions, SSH, Games etc.. too, and to block UDP
%look at zerotier notes, consider for linux, you need to input the network to join, while there is auth, you could accidently expose yourself, incredibly useful, with experience and care, game changing
%hijacked accounts provide a good botnet, new bot accounts dont look as convincing
%CSRF, SFRF, web testing terms, stored and reflected, blind sql injection with sleep, portswigger is good for this
%dns exfil, how many dns requests, what length etc.. Can catch tunneling with sessions. - Sunburst used it, very recent, supply chain update attack malware, look at bookmark
%poc should look at both sides, infiltration and exfiltration, maybe try to decode subdomains with most common ciphers? - have a list of all non ciphered delimiter options
%decryption to something that doesnt make sense, to avoid recogintion
%sandbox malware system to only malware transmission
%email spoofing - can be used for validation emails too
%https://huntresslabs.com/
%pulic and private cert keys are better than addressing rules, lack of meaningful spoofing. UDP IP can be spoofed.
%zerotier can be better, cant really spoof it's device indentifiers for onsite firewall rules.

%"Another added advantage is that I can add a UFW/iptables rule to block all inbound traffic to SSH and other services originating from all IP addresses other than my home and ZeroTier IP address ranges."
%a bit like your own cloud
% https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=weVmuRnLM70 very good video for ransomware, and hard coding the decryption key instead of entropic tables, meaning rev engineering can expose it from the applciation

% optional subdomain spammer? Once a malcious subdomain has been captured and lookup'd securely?
% Do I need to give some attack tools to prove defence?

%Create example program that connects to web https api with key, as example payload - /dev/urandom

%Use a domain name list, local lookup, else more manual checks are done - no reason for symbols, = might mean base64, automatic decoding?
%as well as detection, I'd need a C2 server and attack tool made

%Possible issues on private domains
%Local list
%Length of subdomain (average? Longest of list? Could be abused)
%Manual lookup
%binwalk malware?

\section{Background}
We must find new ways of solving existing and new problems in the world, often with technology. 
This is useful for convenience, and quality of life, but does pose a problem for security. 
There is Hypponen's law in IOT security that states, the more you add in terms of functionality, the more that must be secured. \citep{hypponen}
This law is applicable to infrastructure also, potentially to a larger impact due to the scalability of network infrastructure.
It is a 'cat and mouse' game of which defence is paramount. \citep{cutandmouse}

Cyber-Security is really ``Managed insecurity'' \citep{ManagedInsecurity}.
Cyber threats are growing, how can be detect them? How can we proactively block them? These are questions that must be answered in order to get a good overview.

Developing realistic solutions for smaller businesses is crucial. They are more at risk, with less resources for security. \citep{sme}
The is a culture of security snake-oil, scare-ware, and supposed all-in-one solutions rather than overarching defence-in-depth. This is evident in the numerous adverts that claim much and only deliver a specific defence. \citep{SnakeOil}
I must look at current solutions with a critical eye and care to be realistic about defence. 

Malware has evolved over time, what was once an exercise of what was possible, is now a platform for theft and crime. \citep{malwareHistory}


\section{Proposed Work}
\label{proposed}
I will create a proof of concept intrusion detection system that can detect a few pattern based attacks, conducting the research necessary, including experiment of threats vs defence.
This will be a proof of concept to show my understanding, rather than a product. It will also illustrate the scale that corporate products can run at, including extra methods that are out of scope for me. 
I must be able to show my understanding in a theoretical and practical way to be able to potentially apply it to a real life scenario. 

This will involve talking about infrastructure directly, it's use, implementation and potential pitfalls, but more importantly, how it can be secured.
On the other side, I will be looking at the common ways that infrastructure is compromised, in a network setting. By looking at both sides of infrastructure with a purple team perspective, 
I can gain a deep understanding of the landscape we have currently and moving forwards.  I intend to discover different cyber attack types, and how they have innovated over the years. 
Defences catch up over time, it will be eye-opening to see the historic methodology, and how the two sides try to out-smart each other. \citep{malwareHistory}

The dissertation will have the approach of being an overview, as it is the best way to cover the bigger picture. 
I will go into relative depth where it is necessary. 

An investigation into threats would be pointless without a practical defence, 
I will compare and analyse both endpoint and infrastructure defences in relation to both a sample of threats, and to one another. 

Details of the experiments will come in the synthesis, as it entirely depends on my research to which exact direction I go in. 
Malware analysis is something I haven't had much experience in, though I have be interested for a while now. It will benefit my defence capability greatly.
There will be a dedicated computer for this kind of analysis, likely using a VMware hypervisor for containment and infrastructure management, with more details in the synthesis.

I will be investigating how threats have evolved as a whole, talking about malware mechanisms, obfuscation and clever exfiltration. 
I believe it is important to at least touch on how this was done in the past, to understand how the future may follow similar foundations. 

I will then analyse this data and draw sensible conclusions based upon the research and practical work.

\section{Structure and Contents of the Report}
\subsection{Planned Report Structure (Order may change)}


\paragraph{Introduction} - This chapter sets out the basis of the project, the motivations behind it and what I am looking to investigate. 
It will summarise the whole project.

\paragraph{Analyse historic \& modern defence} - This chapter is a broad overview of the cat and mouse game, with a focus on how both sides evolve over time, 
and how to tip the scales in the defences favour. Analysis of defence technologies directly after (Anomaly Detection, signature matching, whitelisting etc..). 

This chapter then covers cases of past incidents, how they happened, why they were effective and what we can learn from them for modern day. 
I will cover an assortment of notable malware. History and modern may be split into two paragraphs.

\paragraph{Explanation of entry points and profiling} - This chapter covers the idea of what a vulnerability is at it's core, how they are found
and the commonalities among vulnerabilities. It will include the discussion of common pen-testing tools for the enumeration/scanning phase.
Additonally I will look at common attack vectors for malware to get in.

\paragraph{Explanation of malware mechanisms} - This chapter covers the common mechanisms of exploitation and stealth that malware makes use of. 
This includes the use of obfuscation, encryption, exfiltration and the impacts they have. This covers a description of the methods, rather than ouright historic implementation.
May be split into their own sections/chapters for the sake of detail.

\paragraph{Secure Environment Setup} - Discussion of the malware analysis lab created will be conducted, including choices of approach and software.

\paragraph{Investigate antivirus systems w/ comparison} - This chapter is to lay out my experiment methodology, why I did what I did, what I'd expect vs what I got and an analysis of the results themselves.  A sample of threats/malware may be tested in relation to set defences.

\paragraph{Investigate IDS/IPS systems w/ comparison} - This chapter is to lay out my experiment methodology, why I did what I did, what I'd expect vs what I got and an analysis of the results themselves. A sample of threats/malware may be tested in relation to set defences.

\paragraph{Proof of Concept IDS} - I will talk about the choices made regarding it's development, what I used and how it performs in relation to what I have learnt.

\paragraph{Discussion of meaningful defence} - This chapter encompasses what can be done to aid defence to it's maximum. I will focus on defense in depth and diversification of defence mechanisms. 
Topics include, proper training, access control, security positive culture, adequate funding, regular security testing, development infrastructure and a wide variety of hardware solutions. 
Will likely be split into sub paragraphs and sections as it's a vast topic.

\subsection{Conclusion} This will summarise all that was found, how it relates to what I set out to discover and what it means for the future of defence.
